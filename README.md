# balanced-brackets

Simple exercise to check if the brackets in a given string (made only of brackets) are balanced (for each open brakcet there is a matching closing bracket at the same nesting level).

The solution has been submitted on HackerRank; tests have been built using some HackerRanks tests input.

## Usage

```
lein run <string>
```
